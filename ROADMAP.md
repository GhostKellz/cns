# CNS (Crypto Name Server) - Development Roadmap

## üéØ Vision
CNS aims to be the premier Web5.0 DNS infrastructure, seamlessly bridging traditional internet naming with blockchain-based, cryptographically-secure domain ownership. Our goal is to create a future where domain names are truly owned by users through NFTs, resistant to censorship, and integrated with the next generation of internet protocols.
